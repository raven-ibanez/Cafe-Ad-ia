# ✅ QR Ph Payment Method - Implementation Complete!

## 🎉 What Was Added

I've successfully added **QR Ph (QR Philippines)** payment method support to your Cafe Adeia ordering system. The implementation is **fully editable via the admin dashboard** with **zero code changes required** for future updates.

## 📦 Deliverables

### 1. Database Migration ✅
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251022000000_add_qr_ph_payment_method.sql`

This SQL file adds QR Ph to your payment methods. Just run it once in Supabase and you're done!

### 2. Code Updates ✅
**File:** `src/types/index.ts`

Updated TypeScript types to include 'qr-ph' as a valid payment method option.

### 3. Complete Documentation ✅

## 💻 Technical Details

### Database:
```sql
-- New row in payment_methods table
id:              'qr-ph'
name:            'QR Ph'
account_number:  'Scan QR Code to Pay' (you'll edit this)
account_name:    'Cafe Adeia' (you'll edit this)
qr_code_url:     '[placeholder]' (you'll upload your QR)
active:          false (you'll activate it)
sort_order:      4 (you can change this)
```

### TypeScript:
```typescript
// Added to PaymentMethod type
type PaymentMethod = 
  | 'gcash' 
  | 'maya' 
  | 'bank-transfer' 
  | 'qr-ph'           // ← NEW
  | 'cash-on-delivery';
```

### React Components:
```typescript
// Already compatible! No changes needed.
// The components dynamically load payment methods
// from the database, so QR Ph works automatically.
```

## 🔒 Security

### ⚠️ Recommendation:
