## Code Changes Summary

### TypeScript Types (`src/types/index.ts`)

**Before:**
```typescript
export type PaymentMethod = 'gcash' | 'maya' | 'bank-transfer' | 'cash-on-delivery';
```

**After:**
```typescript
export type PaymentMethod = 'gcash' | 'maya' | 'bank-transfer' | 'qr-ph' | 'cash-on-delivery';
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Type-safe payment method selection
- ✅ Autocomplete in IDE
- ✅ Compile-time error checking
- ✅ No runtime changes needed

### OrderData Interface (`src/types/index.ts`)

**Before:**
```typescript
paymentMethod: 'gcash' | 'maya' | 'bank-transfer' | 'cash-on-delivery';
```

**After:**
```typescript
paymentMethod: PaymentMethod;
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- ✅ Single source of truth for payment types
- ✅ Easier maintenance

## No Changes Required

### ✅ Components That Already Support QR Ph

**Checkout Component** (`src/components/Checkout.tsx`)
- Already fetches payment methods dynamically
- Already displays QR codes for selected methods
- Already shows account details
- **Lines 390-404:** Dynamic payment method rendering
- **Lines 408-430:** QR code display logic

**Payment Method Manager** (`src/components/PaymentMethodManager.tsx`)
- Already supports CRUD operations
- Already has image upload functionality
- Already handles active/inactive toggle
- Already supports sort ordering

**usePaymentMethods Hook** (`src/hooks/usePaymentMethods.ts`)
- Already fetches all payment methods
- Already filters active methods for customers
- Already supports full CRUD operations

## Database Schema

### payment_methods Table Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE payment_methods (
  id text PRIMARY KEY,           -- 'qr-ph'
  name text NOT NULL,             -- 'QR Ph'
  account_number text NOT NULL,   -- Account details or instructions
  account_name text NOT NULL,     -- Account holder name
  qr_code_url text NOT NULL,      -- QR code image URL
  active boolean DEFAULT true,    -- Show/hide from customers
  sort_order integer DEFAULT 0,   -- Display order in checkout
  created_at timestamptz,
  updated_at timestamptz
);
```

### Default QR Ph Entry
```sql
id: 'qr-ph'
name: 'QR Ph'
account_number: 'Scan QR Code to Pay'
account_name: 'Cafe Adeia'
qr_code_url: '[placeholder image]'
active: false  ← Must be activated by admin
sort_order: 4
```

         ↓
Checkout component renders QR code
         ↓
Customer scans and pays
         ↓
Screenshot sent via Messenger
```

### Admin Flow
```

## Security Considerations

### ✅ Already Implemented
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Public can only read active methods
- Admin requires authentication
- Updated_at triggers in place

### ⚠️ Recommendations
- Change hardcoded admin password
- Implement proper backend auth
- Add rate limiting
- Enable 2FA for admin access
- Regular security audits

## Browser Compatibility

### Tested On:
- [ ] Chrome/Edge (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Mobile Chrome
- [ ] Mobile Safari

### Features Used:
- ✅ ES6+ JavaScript (supported by Vite/build)
- ✅ CSS Grid/Flexbox (universal support)
- ✅ Fetch API (universal support)
- ✅ LocalStorage (universal support)

## Performance Considerations

### Image Optimization
- ✅ QR codes should be < 500KB
- ✅ Supabase Storage handles compression
- ✅ Lazy loading on checkout page
- ✅ Error fallback image provided

### Database Queries
- ✅ Indexed on `active` and `sort_order`
- ✅ Cached by `usePaymentMethods` hook
- ✅ Single query for all methods
- ✅ No N+1 query issues

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Track These Metrics:
- [ ] QR Ph selection rate
- [ ] Payment success rate
- [ ] Customer support tickets
- [ ] QR code scan issues
- [ ] Payment verification time

### Tools to Use:
- Supabase Dashboard for database stats
- Google Analytics for user behavior
- Messenger for customer feedback
- Bank app for payment confirmations

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Occur:

**Option 1: Deactivate**
```
1. Go to admin dashboard
2. Edit QR Ph payment method
3. Uncheck "Active Payment Method"
4. Save
```

**Option 2: Database Rollback**
```sql
-- Deactivate QR Ph
UPDATE payment_methods 
SET active = false 
WHERE id = 'qr-ph';
```

**Option 3: Delete Entry**
```sql
-- Remove QR Ph completely
DELETE FROM payment_methods 
WHERE id = 'qr-ph';
```

**Option 4: Code Rollback**
```typescript
// Revert types/index.ts
export type PaymentMethod = 
  'gcash' | 'maya' | 'bank-transfer' | 'cash-on-delivery';
```
